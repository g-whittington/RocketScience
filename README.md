# Project Boost

A 3D game built in Godot.

## Description

Project Boost is a 3D game where you control a rocket player character. You fly through levels using forces, accelerate, and rotate around obstacles. Crash into an obstacle and you die, having to restart the level.

This is a full project made using Godot, from the ground up. We are making our own scripts to control the rocket.

## Features

*   **Force-Based Movement:** The player character uses forces to move through the level, accelerating and rotating around obstacles.
*   **Collision Detection:** Crashes into obstacles result in death and restart the level.
*   **Level Progression:** Reach goals to advance to new levels.
*   **Full Game Export:** The project can be exported as a standalone game for distribution.

## Development Tools Used:

*   Godot Engine
