# Project Boost

A 3D game built in Godot.

## Description

Project Boost is a 3D game where you control a rocket player character. You fly through levels using forces, accelerate, and rotate around obstacles. Crash into an obstacle and you die, having to restart the level.

## Learning Outcomes

*   **Force-Based Movement:** Implement a force-based movement system to enable the player character to fly, accelerate, and rotate within a 3D environment.
*   **Collision Detection:** Detect collisions between the player character and obstacles, triggering game events such as death and level restarts.
*   **Manage Level Progression:** Design a system that allows players to progress through a series of levels by reaching defined goals. This will also cover how to Create a series of levels.
*   **Audio and Particle Effects:**  Integrate audio effects and particle systems to enhance the game's feedback and visual appeal.

## Development Tools Used:

*   Godot Engine 4.3
